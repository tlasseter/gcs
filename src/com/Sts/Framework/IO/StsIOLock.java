/**
 This reader/writer lock prevents reads from occurring while writes are
 in progress, and it also prevents multiple writes from
 happening simultaneously. Multiple read operations can run in parallel,
 however. Reads take priority over writes, so any read operations that
 are pending while a write is in progress will execute before any
 subsequent writes execute. Writes are guaranteed to execute in the
 order in which they were requested -- the oldest request is processed
 first.

 You should use the lock as follows:

 public class Data_structure_or_resource
 {
  Reader_writer lock = new Reader_writer();

  public void access( )
  {
   try
   {   lock.request_read();
  // do the read/access operation here.
   }
   finally
   {   lock.read_accomplished();
   }
  }

  public void modify( )
  {
   try
   {   lock.request_write();
  // do the write/modify operation here.
   }
   finally
   {   lock.write_accomplished();
   }
  }
 }

 This implementation is based on the one in Doug Lea's Concurrent
 Programming in Java (Addison Wesley, 1997, pp. 300-303), I've
 simplified the code (and cleaned it up) and added the nonblocking
 acquisition methods.  I've also made the lock a standalone class rather
 than a base class from which you have to derive. You might also want to
 look at the very different implementation of the reader/writer lock in
 Scott Oaks and Henry Wong's Java Threads (O'Reilly, 1997, pp.
 180-187).
